# 👀 Hey there! I'm Aayush. 

I am first-year Research Student at Texas A&M University. I am currently researching how to use ML to predict *Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation* heat transport using Sea-Surface Height and Temperature (As a Research Assistant in the Department of Oceanography). I used to work on Distributred Systems, and Machine Learning at LinkedIn. 

### 💡 Stuff I think is cool! (I cringe at my old code every day, dw)

- Check out muCLIar. It got 100+ stars. I was too lazy to play music through a browser, so I spent a month building a tool to play it through CLI. Yes, the irony isn't lost on me.
- Though not Open Source, I trained a Graph Neural Network to create a "Knowledge Graph" for LinkedIn's internal documentation. A lot of us used it for new-hire onboarding.
- Launched a D2C brand! Check [it](https://aakhar.in) out

### 💡 What I'm interested in

I am really passionate about how things work at scale, and I try my best to fiddle around with some code to aid that. I like to think I am a product-driven person (or just a bad engineer). I have worked extensively with Computer Vision in the past and I hold that interest dearly as well.

### 👨🏽‍🎓Here's what I'm currently learning:

- Oceanography
- Interpretable ML
- Mathematics
