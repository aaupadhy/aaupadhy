# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aayush

**Note:** Iâ€™ve lost access to my original GitHub account (`aayush1205`), so Iâ€™ve forked my older repositories here for continuity.

I'm a second-year Computer Science MS CS student at Texas A&M, currently a Research Assistant in the Department of Oceanography working on ML for physical sciences â€” using spatiotemporal Vision Transformers to predict heat transport across the Atlantic. Itâ€™s compute-heavy, high-dimensional, and way too fun.

Before grad school, I engineered distributed infra at LinkedIn, built services that touched 100K+ QPS, and designed fault-tolerant systems for ML production. Iâ€™ve also dabbled in GNNs, launched a D2C brand, and built a CLI music player because browsers were too much effort.
